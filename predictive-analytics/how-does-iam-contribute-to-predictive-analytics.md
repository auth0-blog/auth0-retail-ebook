# How Does Iam Contribute to Predictive Analytics?

There are a number of ways that IAM can contribute to predictive analytics, but one of the biggest and most underutilized is gathering information with your identity management system. Login can give you a window into who your users are, what they're doing, when they're doing it and how often. 

Some of the data that your IAM can collect is:

* Location
* Device type
* IP Address
* Number of logins
* Timestamp of logins

These are all important factors when figuring out user behavior, especially number of logins, behavioral data which shows how engaged a user is with you. 

But that's not all that an IAM can help you learn. Beyond the obvious, an IAM can help you gather information by:

- **Gathering social data** by requesting access to all of the preferences and information stored in a user's social platform of choice if they're using social login.
- **Customizing profiles** by automating questions to be asked at login. When done properly, [progressive profiling](https://auth0.com/blog/how-profile-enrichment-and-progressive-profiling-can-boost-your-marketing/) can give you the data *you *want about your customers without inconveniencing them or invading their privacy. 
- **Enabling demographic research** by running your users through 3rd-party data APIs to get more information about them. With Auth0, you can automate this process by integrating APIs into profile creation with [Rules](https://auth0.com/docs/rules/current), automated functions that trigger at login. If you want more data about, say, the professions, company sizes and professional roles of your users, for example, you could use Auth0 Rules to automatically run users' emails through [Clearbit](https://clearbit.com/), an API that pulls professional information. 

All of these types of data can be directly funneled into predictive models. Remember that one of the key components to creating predictive analytics for your company is *good data collection* and another is a *deep and unbiased understanding of your users*. If you aren't utilizing your IAM to help you get both of these things, you're missing a huge opportunity and setting yourself back in the process.
