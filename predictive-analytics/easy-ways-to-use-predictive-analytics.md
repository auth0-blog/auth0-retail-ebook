# Easy ways to use predictive analytics

The potential of predictive analytics is huge, but it's a complex field that can be intimidating to unravel. Here are some of the easier ways to use predictive analytics — but keep in mind that even the simplest application will still require that rigorous back-end work to be successful. 

## Marketing

Our Tesco example was a hint at this, but one of the most predominant ways to utilize predictive analytics is marketing. This helps you tailor your marketing efforts to better sell to specific customers by looking at past data on what similar customers have bought or done. 

A great example of tailoring your marketing efforts based on data is Geckoboard's [system](https://clearbit.com/books/data-driven-sales/inbound-lead-qualification) for qualifying leads. They realized that their template for their “ideal customer” was leaving out the majority of the leads they were generating, leaving marketing with a soup of people to manually sort through. 

They decided to enrich their data to get a more complete view of their users, and use new information about the types of leads they were pulling in to autoscore leads with a more complex system:

This system was developed based on a combination of user behavior and good data that they automated into their system through the Clearbit API. 

These tactics are obviously not limited to discounts or leads — they could be different email copy, coupons, or ads that speak to the likely purchases, desires and vulnerabilities of a given consumer. 

## Sales revenue

Predictive analytics can lead to better sales projections because you are making a more concerted effort to collect data on customers and use it to predict outcomes. 

Take [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/itshowcase/Article/Content/770/Predictive-analytics-improves-the-accuracy-of-forecasted-sales-revenue) — the company recently revealed that they've ramped up predictive analytics in their sales department in a big way. By integrating predictive analysis into their sales process, they're getting more accurate sales predictions from top down. Here's what they say about how individual reps are helped by predictive analytics: 


> “[Our most recent] model uses machine-learning algorithms and opportunity-scoring data for near real-time win/loss predictions of a sale. It helps sellers prioritize by showing whether an opportunity is hot, warm, or cold, and advises them about actions to take.”

## IAM security

One of the best examples of this is anomaly detection, a security measure that flags unusual behaviors to keep users safe. For example, Auth0 offers [brute force protection](https://auth0.com/docs/anomaly-detection), which allows you to trigger security measures if someone makes too many attempts on a login. 

This type of security relies on regular user behavior — like not trying to sign in to their account 20 times in a row — and uses it to help keep users safe. You've probably been the beneficiary of protection based on your behavior without even realizing it. An email that says, “we got a login from a new computer or location — is this you?” is another type of identity protection that relies on predicting user behaviors.

*A security email from Dropbox notes what location, time, web browser and computer are used in a login attempt that doesn't match a users' predicted (i.e. previous) behavior.*

With an IAM system like Auth0, turning on security features like brute force protection is as simple as choosing a couple of preset options, and should be a no-brainer to incorporate this type of predictive analytics technology into your business.
