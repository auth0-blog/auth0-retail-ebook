# What Is Predictive Analytics?

Simply put, predictive analytics is using data to make highly informed guesses about future outcomes. For businesses, the most common application of this is in [user behavior](https://amplitude.com/blog/2016/06/14/10-steps-behavioral-analytics/). By observing what past users have done, you should be able to better understand what future users will do. Businesses use this to shape users' paths to increase predictability. 

For example, Tesco, a UK grocer, [used](https://hbr.org/2011/12/know-what-your-customers-want-before-they-do) user behavior data to see what their rewards program members were buying together. They noticed that “Clubcard shoppers who buy diapers for the first time at a Tesco store are mailed coupons not only for baby wipes and toys but also for beer.” Why? “Data analysis revealed that new fathers tend to buy more beer because they are spending less time at the pub.”

This is a clean example, and to get to a place where your business can boast good predictive modeling requires a couple of things that are implicit in the mascara/eyeliner scenario:

- **Good data collection** from all parts of your business at all times.
- **Deep understanding of customer behavior** that is based in data and not gut feeling or supposition
- **Predictive analytics tools** that makes your data workable and tracks your experiments

This forms the groundwork of success with predictive analytics. There's no reason why any company can't start utilizing their data in order to make predictive analytics work for them, and most companies will have some — if not all — of these systems set up already. 

But whether you're all set up or just starting out, you probably aren't fulfilling your predictive analytic potential. For example, how are you using your identity management (IAM) to help with predictive modeling? Are you using it at all? If you really want to get serious about your predictive capability, then you can't overlook it as a powerful avenue for predictive analytics.
