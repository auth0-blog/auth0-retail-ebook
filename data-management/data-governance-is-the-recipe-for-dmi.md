# Data Governance is the Recipe for DMI

You can't make a great soufflé without a clear and detailed recipe that describes exactly how to prepare the ingredients, put them together and bake the final product.

Successfully managing your data starts with a “recipe” called data governance. The role of data governance is to establish **standard policies and procedures** across the organization that set the parameters for managing all of your data.

A comprehensive data governance plan defines user rights, security policies, and monitors the technologies used to implement the various data procedures.

Data governance is the blueprint on how your company manages its data, focusing on three areas: people, policy, and technology.

Data analysts currently waste most of their time, up to [80%](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2016/03/23/data-preparation-most-time-consuming-least-enjoyable-data-science-task-survey-says/#10a8aa6a6f63), identifying and processing data to use before doing any analysis. Good data governance should alleviate this by providing the plan and structure for data to be secure, easily found, and shared among people with the appropriate permissions.
