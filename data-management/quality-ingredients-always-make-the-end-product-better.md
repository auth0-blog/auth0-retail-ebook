# Quality Ingredients Always Make the End Product Better

A soufflé is actually not that hard to make, *if* you know how to prepare the right ingredients. For example, the most important ingredient is egg whites, but if the egg whites have any traces of egg yolk, your soufflé will fail.

Most people don't think about the quality of their data, but, like the tainted egg whites, if your [data is dirty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_data) your insights will not be trustworthy.

Dirty data, such as data with spelling errors or data placed in the wrong field, is a big problem that often goes unnoticed. The power of your analysis is only as good as the [quality of your data](https://www.interana.com/blog/understanding-value-data/). If your data is 99% accurate, your insight might be dead wrong.

Without data management and integration policies in place to ensure data quality, you will almost certainly have costly data inconsistencies. Let's say your customer service team receives a complaint from D. Smith, while your marketing team is sending a promotion to a David Smith at the same time. You'll look incompetent sending conflicting messages to the same person.

Beyond setting policies, a DMI program should include a [data cleansing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_cleansing) process to remedy some of these issues. Data cleansing [tools](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-data-cleansing-tools), such as OpenRefine, reconcile and remove duplicate or incomplete data points.

Your data is generated across dozens of touchpoints, which increases this risk of duplication and redundancy. With a DMI approach that ensures your data is clean and ready for use, you will have the confidence to make decisions based on your analyses.
