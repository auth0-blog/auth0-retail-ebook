# All You Need to Know About Data Management and Integration (DMI)

Chocolate soufflés are just like data-driven insights — they are rich, transformative and really hard to create.

Anyone who has attempted to make a soufflé knows that in order to make it right, you must follow the recipe exactly, prepare the ingredients properly and be methodical with every step of the process. When prepared correctly, a soufflé is magical, but if there is one small error, the whole thing ends in disaster.

Generating insights from your data works the same way. If you don't have a standard process in place to ensure your data is accurate, usable and secure, your insights will be worthless and even misleading. But unlike the ingredients of a soufflé, managing data is extremely complex and the likelihood of making an error is high.

Leveraging the full value of your data and avoiding costly mistakes starts with a data management and integration (DMI) strategy. Simply put, DMI is a set of policies and procedures meant to provide the right people with timely access to accurate data.

With different types of data now coming from hundreds of internal and external sources, the potential for game-changing insights within your company is only matched by the nerve-racking potential for data chaos.

DMI is more important than ever, so we've broken down the four pillars of data management and integration to get you started.
