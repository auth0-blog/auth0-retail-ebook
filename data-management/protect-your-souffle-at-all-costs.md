# Protect Your Soufflé at all Costs

After painstakingly preparing your soufflé, you don't want any unauthorized people in the kitchen to mess with it. If you turn your back for one second and someone opens the oven door, both your soufflé and your mood will be deflated.

A core pillar of DMI is data security. Not a week goes by without news of a massive data breach that compromises the personal information of millions of people. Traditionally, companies kept their data safe by securing their perimeter, but data now comes from the outside and employees access sensitive data with devices beyond the firewall.

One of the biggest data risks within your company has to do with [access management.](https://auth0.com/user-management) A recent survey found that [47%](https://blog.varonis.com/2017-varonis-data-risk-report-47-had-at-least-1000-sensitive-files-exposed/) of companies had at least 1,000 sensitive files open to every employee. Unintentionally giving too much access to employees is a very common problem with dire repercussions.

U.S. retailer, Target, had a data breach where over 40 million credit cards including pin numbers were stolen. While there were many reasons for the breach, a [_report_](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/09/inside-target-corp-days-after-2013-breach/) identified that too many people had access to sensitive data, including remote contractors.

Your DMI policy should determine user access across the enterprise, but when you have hundreds or even thousands of potential users, how can you keep track of everyone?

Identity and access management (IAM) tools, like [_Auth0_](https://auth0.com/learn/cloud-identity-access-management/), are designed to help you manage access to your data. You can authenticate, authorize, and track users that interact with your data at all times and set [rules](https://auth0.com/docs/rules/current) to comply with your data management policies.

For example, your IAM tool enables your team and contractors to access data remotely on any device by adding extra security measures such as [automated logouts](https://auth0.com/docs/logout) and [multifactor authentification.](https://auth0.com/docs/multifactor-authentication) Even if a device is lost or stolen, the data will be secure.
