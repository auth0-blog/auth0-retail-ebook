# Integration Tools Prepare the Data for Analysis

When you are following a recipe, it is sometimes tempting to skip the instructions and mix all the ingredients together at the same time. If you've done this then you know it never ends well.

Integrating your data is exactly the same. Your data that is coming in across all your applications and legacy systems are not compatible. While you need to combine some of it to run your analysis, you can't just throw it all together willy-nilly and expect accurate results.

Data integration is a complicated endeavor when you consider all the structured and unstructured data available to analyze.  There are no one-size-fits-all approaches to data integration, but there are several tools to help automate the integration process of matching, cleaning, and preparing data for analysis.

Data integrations are complex and technical, but at the core are three steps are known as ETL: extraction, transformation, and loading.

* **Data extraction** is when data is collected from all of the various data sources.
* **Data transformation** is the process of transforming all of your data into a compatible format, often with the help of a universal [data model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model) that defines the datasets with common properties.
* **Data loading** is when the right data is loaded into the appropriate database, ready for analysis.

You have so many sources of valuable data, but you can't just throw them in an analytics tool and hope to make sense of it all. Your data management and integration strategy should identify the approach and tools necessary to implement a successful integration.

When the ingredients are prepared and combined properly, your chances of accurate insights and a successful souffl√© go from good to great.
