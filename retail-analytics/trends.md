# Trends in retail analytics

Digital retailing has both given a boost to traditional *retail analytics* and allowed companies to create new ways to follow their digital commerce. While companies are going to continue to refine *retail analytics*, the *retail analytics* trends of today are strongly tied to our ideas about multichannel commerce and will likely continue in this vein. 

## Oldies but goodies

Let's start out with some of the “traditional” *retail analytics* that have stood the test of time. These are some baseline heavy-hitters. Where before, people might have tracked these manually, they have now been supercharged by contemporary analytics platforms. 

* **POS analytics.** Point of Sale analytics, or POS analytics, is a broad field that uses the information that relates to the final sale of an item. This started as simply a log of payments and has progressed as sales technology picked up, gaining steam from the mid-1980s onward. Now, POS analytics will cover not just what was purchased and by whom, but also where that item was stored or shipped from, and information about the customer (rewards points, address, email, etc.). Almost every eCommerce system comes equipped with basic POS analytics — [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/retail/improved-retail-analytics-help-merchants-dive-deeper-into-data-to-bolster-sales) is a great example. 

* **“Traditional” marketing analytics.** Marketing has been around forever, and old-school analytics have made their way over to digital. Tracking the basics of marketing campaigns is easier with marketing tools, and many of them put bells and whistles on basic marketing stats, like ROI on mailing campaigns. Google Analytics or built-in analytics on platforms like Facebook Business often serve as an easy way into this type of data.

## New kids on the block

What's happening in *retail analytics* today isn't just refreshed POS analytics. More data is being collected, which means there's more to dive into. The *retail analytics* trends of today are focused on looking at more micro-level actions or strings of actions that are predictive, rather than simply using analytics to form assessments of marketing schemes or to find macro trends. 

* **Micro marketing analytics.** Digital analytics platforms have allowed businesses a greater window of insight into their marketing analytics. Now, it's easier than ever to look at more micro-level marketing data (like how many impressions a customer needs before they purchase), what items are likely to be purchased together or in subsequent orders, and live updates of A/B testing on campaigns. 

* **Sentiment analysis.** Sentiment analysis is a new way of determining how customers and potential buyers feel about your product. It uses text analysis to determine how your customers are talking about your products on channels from on-site product reviews to comments on your social pages. [Sentiment analysis](https://auth0.com/blog/4-ways-to-calculate-your-customers-happiness) helps predict trends, gauge customer reactions to products and marketing materials, and can be the missing link that explains sales fluctuations.

* **Omnichannel analytics.** With all of the different platforms available to customers, and all of the paths customers take to purchase, getting a robust view of how your customers are purchasing across platforms and devices is crucial. While some software, like [Sellbrite](https://www.sellbrite.com/ecommerce-reporting/), include multi-channel eCommerce reporting, companies also turn to their IAM to help them stitch together [customer identities](https://auth0.com/blog/the-three-best-ways-to-create-the-single-vision-of-a-customer/) across channels. This can help eCommerce companies build and track brand experiences.

## The future 

Moving commerce online was the first in a series of chain reactions that have opened an entirely new world for retail and marketing. Even though technology and techniques seem to move at lightening speed, the truth is that eCommerce, shopping and marketing analysis, and behavioral analysis of customers has been slow to perfect. While getting targeting capabilities, cart abandonment numbers, and CTR stats has been quick, true customization for retailers, shoppers, and marketers is just beginning. 

* **Better predictions and forecasting.** While companies like [SAS](https://www.sas.com/en_us/solutions/analytics.html#forecasting) are investing a lot of energy into building forecasting capabilities, [predictive analytics](https://auth0.com/blog/predictive-analytics-why-is-it-important/) for retail will get better as more customer data is collected and software is better able to track and integrate that data across channels. Because predictions and forecasting are holistic efforts, as each part of data-rich eCommerce improves, so will these capabilities.

* **More IoT data.** It's no secret that the IoT has more and more [use cases](https://www.interana.com/blog/the-top-iot-analytics-use-cases-today/) as each year passes. More connected devices will mean a better picture of your eCommerce customer and their behaviors. eCommerce is also likely to build its own integrations with IoT devices — think [Farmstead](https://www.farmsteadapp.com/) integrated with your smart fridge — and this will bring a whole new set of data to process.
