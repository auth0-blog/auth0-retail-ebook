# What Can You Expect from Retail Analytics?

When something encompasses production through sales, its possibilities seem almost endless. Right now, though, the big uses for *retail analytics* center on optimizing procurement, optimizing merchandising, and optimizing marketing.

## Optimizing Procurement

One of the key places that *retail analytics* helps businesses is **optimizing procurement**. By better predicting sales numbers, procurement and stocking gets more efficient. Retailers can also better see the cost balance for a given materials vendor, with more visibility into how the different purchases from a single vendor add up. 

## Optimizing Merchandising

When it comes to merchandising, **product appeal** has always been a huge consideration for retailers. With digital marketing and eCommerce, it's only gotten more important. The color of landing pages, the music in product videos, the packaging that an item comes in when someone receives it in the mail — these things are all important factors that replicate the “in-store experience” for digital consumers. And they're things that marketers are testing to optimize for the most appeal to online shoppers, who have their attention going in 700 different directions.

Another big place that companies are constantly tweaking with the help of *retail analytics* is **pricing**. Companies like [Price Intelligently](http://www.priceintelligently.com/) have made whole businesses off of analyzing how to optimize pricing by digging into data about customers, price points, and pricing strategies. Even companies that aren't outsourcing their pricing strategy are still paying close attention to what their consumer data tells them about how much a customer is willing to pay for their product.

## Optimizing Marketing

The digital age birthed more sales channels than ever before, and now it's rushing to catch up to them. Consumers find their way to products across social media, shopping websites, word of mouth, meatspace ad campaigns, emails, and magazines. To track all of these channels is difficult, but *retail analytics* is getting better at tracking across devices and digital channels to give a better idea of **which ads are working online**. 

**Ad targeting** is another area that can be positively influenced by *retail analytics*. As users login with their social accounts for eCommerce sites, see targeted ads on social media, and are retargeted after purchase, more information about their demographics, habits, likes, and dislikes are gathered. This means that *retail analytics* can streamline ad targeting for happier customers and happier marketers.
