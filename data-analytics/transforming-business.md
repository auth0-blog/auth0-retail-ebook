# Data Analytics Is Transforming Business

Believe it or not, your company creates just as much data as a Formula 1 team, if not more. Every operational task and customer interaction generates valuable data that you can analyze to make better decisions and uncover insights with the power to transform your business.

The companies that have embraced data analytics not only outperform their competitors, but they continually exceed expectations.

According to the report from [McKinsey Global Institute](https://www.mckinseyonmarketingandsales.com/sites/default/files/pdf/Datamatics.pdf), companies that use data analytics to make decisions across their business have a 23x greater likelihood of customer acquisition, a 6x greater likelihood of reducing customer churn, and a 19x greater likelihood of being profitable.
