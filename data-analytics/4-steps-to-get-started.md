Don't be overwhelmed by the thought of implementing data analytics in your business. You are already generating a lot of data within your current systems and today's analytics tools have become accessible and easy to integrate.

**Step 1: Set clear objectives.** Data analytics should always start with a business objective. Are you trying to reduce fuel costs like UPS or reduce customer churn like T-Mobile? Once you establish your goals, it will be much easier to figure out your questions and the data you will need to find answers.

**Step 2: Identify the right data.** When you know what you want to achieve, the next step is to find the best data and metrics within your technology applications. For example, if you want to [track your customer experience](https://www.zendesk.com/resources/why-companies-should-invest-in-the-customer-experience/) across social and your site, you could use an identity management tool like Auth0 to [collect your customers'](https://auth0.com/blog/360-view-of-customer-by-managing-identity/) social media data.

**Step 3: Use a tool to analyze data.** In the past, you needed a data analyst who was highly trained in statistics. Technology has changed the game, giving every business of every size the ability to get answers from their data. If you do not have an IT team to help you, there are several self-service analytics tools available, such as [Interana](https://www.interana.com/product), that are designed to use your data to answer your questions.

**Step 4: Make the decision.** Data analysis gives you the information necessary to make a decision or take an action, but it can't make the decisions for you  â€” at least not yet. Your ability to interpret the data and act on the insights is what truly sets you apart from the competition.

To help you interpret your analysis, ask yourself these three questions:

* How does the conclusion answer the question?
* Does the data help defend against any objections? How?
* Can the insights be used to make tangible changes to the business?

Technology is making it possible for every business to collect and analyze data without the need for data scientists or even IT. At the end of the day, it is not your lack of data or analytics tools that will make the difference. It is your ability to set clear objectives, ask the right questions and act on the insights from the analysis.
