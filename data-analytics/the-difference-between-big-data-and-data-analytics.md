# The Difference Between Big Data and Data Analytics

Formula 1 cars [transmit](https://channels.theinnovationenterprise.com/articles/f1-and-data-analytics-it-s-a-numbers-game) 2GB of data every lap and 3TB during a full race. When you consider there are 20 races per season, the cars are generating over 60 [terabytes](https://www.lifewire.com/terabytes-gigabytes-amp-petabytes-how-big-are-they-4125169) of data.

While that is a huge amount of data, the race-time decisions are not driven by the amount of data, but rather by questions that need answers. This is the fundamental difference between Big Data and Data Analytics.

* **What is Big Data?** It's [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data) as high-volume, high-velocity and/or high-variety information assets (data) that require innovative forms of information processing to collect, clean, store and use.
* **What is Data Analytics?** It's the process of examining data with a specific objective in mind to find answers that help you make evidence-backed business decisions.

The 60TB of data collected during a Formula 1 season is big data. It's a huge *volume* of data that consists of different types of data(*variety*), both [structured and unstructured](https://brightplanet.com/2012/06/structured-vs-unstructured-data/). Analysts and data scientists must process this type of data using powerful computing systems and then sift through it to discover trends or correlations that can help solve problems.

This type of exploratory big data analytics usually leads to new, macro-level efficiencies for your business. For example, the Formula 1 team might discover by analyzing their big data that they have slower lap times when they use a certain type of fuel. By changing the fuel, they might give themselves a better chance of winning.

Data analytics, on the other hand, is designed to help you answer questions around [specific business objectives](https://auth0.com/blog/insight-execution-why-analytics-matter/). In the same way a Formula 1 team wants to know which lap is best for a pit stop, data analytics helps you answer questions that help your business win.

Data analytics is the process of using data (facts) to solve problems. Whether you are manually analyzing the data or using an automated analytics application, such as [Interana](https://www.interana.com/) or [DataHero](https://datahero.com/resource/predictive-data-analytics/), data analysis always starts with a question and then examines the data to find answers.
