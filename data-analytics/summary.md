# How Data Analytics Can Transform Your Business

Each car is equipped with over 150 sensors that track key performance stats in real time such as fuel efficiency, tire pressure, brake heat, GPS and wind speeds. Each sensor is a data source that is analyzed to help answer specific questions during the race that gives the team a competitive advantage.

For example, Formula 1 analysts can use the data to determine which laps the car should stop for a pit stop. Would it be faster to do a pit stop at lap 10 or lap 14? In a sport where seconds matter, the right answer can help the team win.

While the massive amount of data generated by the car is important, the *analytics* that translates the data into actionable insights is what delivers the value during the race.

**Your business is just like a Formula 1 race car.**

Okay, you might not be a global celebrity, popping champagne after each win, but similar to Formula 1, your business generates a lot of data that can be used to answer questions that give you a competitive advantage. Understanding how to leverage data analytics can make the difference between your company winning or losing the race.
